Title: Understand NIST Incident Response Life Cycle
Objective: Familiarize yourself with the four main phases of the NIST SP 800-61 Incident Response Life Cycle and their importance.
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Tools Needed: Access to NIST SP 800-61 R2 document (online or PDF), web browser
Setup Instructions:
    - Access the NIST SP 800-61 R2 publication (e.g., via NIST website: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf).

## Steps

1.  **Locate NIST SP 800-61 R2 Document**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the official NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2, "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide".
    *   Spend a few minutes skimming the table of contents and introduction to get a general overview.

2.  **Identify the Four Phases**
    *   Locate Section 2.1, "The Incident Response Life Cycle," or similar introductory sections.
    *   Identify and list the four primary phases of the incident response life cycle as defined by NIST.

3.  **Summarize Each Phase**
    *   For each of the four phases, read its description within the document (e.g., Chapter 3 for detailed explanations).
    *   In your own words, write a brief summary (2-3 sentences) explaining the main goals and activities of each phase.

4.  **Understand the Iterative Nature**
    *   Reflect on how these phases are not always strictly sequential but often overlap or iterate, especially in complex incidents. Consider how lessons learned from one incident can feed back into the "Preparation" phase for future incidents.

5.  **Identify Key Outputs/Deliverables of Each Phase**
    *   For each phase, consider what tangible outcomes or deliverables would typically result from completing the activities within that phase (e.g., an incident response plan, an incident report, forensic data).

## Reflection Questions

1.  Why is a structured incident response framework like NIST SP 800-61 important for organizations?
2.  Which phase do you think is the most critical for effective incident response, and why?
3.  How does understanding the incident response life cycle help in proactive security measures?

## Next Steps

*   [Review and Develop Incident Response Policy Components](02-incident-response-policy.md)
*   Further reading: [NIST SP 800-61 R2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)

## Hints / Troubleshooting

*   **Document Access**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection to access the NIST document.
*   **Key Concepts**: Focus on understanding the core purpose of each phase rather than memorizing every detail.
*   **Practical Application**: Try to think of real-world examples for each phase to solidify your understanding.
