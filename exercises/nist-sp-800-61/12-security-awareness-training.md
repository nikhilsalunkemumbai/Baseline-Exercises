Title: Design a Security Awareness Training Module for Incident Prevention
Objective: Develop the key components of a security awareness training module focused on incident prevention, recognizing that employee education is a critical part of the NIST Preparation phase.
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Tools Needed: Text editor or presentation software (conceptual outline)
Setup Instructions:
    - Review Section 3.1.3 "Training" in NIST SP 800-61 R2.
    - Consider common human-related factors contributing to security incidents (e.g., phishing, weak passwords, accidental disclosures).
---

## Steps

1.  **Review NIST Guidance on Training**
    *   Revisit NIST SP 800-61 R2 and locate sections that discuss the importance of training for all personnel, not just the incident response team.
    *   Understand how general security awareness contributes to incident prevention and overall organizational security posture.

2.  **Define Training Goals and Target Audience**
    *   **Goal:** What do you want employees to *know* and *do* after completing this module? (e.g., "Employees will be able to identify phishing attempts," "Employees will know how to report a suspicious email.")
    *   **Audience:** Assume the module is for all general employees of a mid-sized company.

3.  **Identify Key Incident Prevention Topics**
    *   Based on common attack vectors and your understanding of incident types, list at least 5-7 crucial topics that should be covered in an incident prevention training module.
    *   *Hints:* Think about human vulnerabilities and initial access points for attackers.

4.  **Outline the Training Module Content**
    *   For each identified topic, outline the key information, examples, and actionable advice that would be provided to employees.
    *   Consider how to make the content engaging and memorable.
    *   Also, include a section on "What to do if you suspect an incident."

5.  **Suggest Delivery Methods and Assessment**
    *   How would this training typically be delivered (e.g., online module, in-person)?
    *   How would you assess whether employees have understood the material?

## Security Awareness Training Module: Incident Prevention (Conceptual Outline)

### Training Goal
Upon completion of this module, employees will be able to recognize common cyber threats, understand their role in preventing security incidents, and know the correct procedures for reporting suspicious activities or potential incidents.

### Target Audience
All employees of the organization (general workforce).

### Module Structure and Content

---

#### **Module Section 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity & Your Role**
*   **What is Cybersecurity?** Brief, non-technical explanation.
*   **Why You Matter:** Emphasize that security is everyone's responsibility, not just IT's.
*   **Consequences of Incidents:** Briefly touch upon personal (e.g., identity theft) and organizational (e.g., data loss, reputation damage) impacts.

---

#### **Module Section 2: Phishing & Social Engineering (The Human Element)**
*   **What is Phishing?** Definition, common types (spear phishing, whaling).
*   **How to Spot Phishing:**
    *   **Sender Check:** Verify email addresses, not just display names.
    *   **Link Hovering:** How to safely check URLs before clicking.
    *   **Urgency/Threats:** Recognizing scare tactics.
    *   **Grammar/Spelling:** Common red flags.
    *   **Unexpected Attachments:** Dangers of unsolicited files.
*   **Actionable Advice:** "Stop, Look, Think" before clicking.

---

#### **Module Section 3: Strong Password Practices & Account Security**
*   **Why Strong Passwords?** Explain brute-force attacks and credential stuffing.
*   **Password Best Practices:**
    *   Use long, complex passphrases (e.g., "correct-horse-battery-staple").
    *   Avoid reusing passwords.
    *   Use a password manager.
    *   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) everywhere possible.
*   **Actionable Advice:** Never share passwords, change defaults immediately.

---

#### **Module Section 4: Protecting Sensitive Data**
*   **What is Sensitive Data?** Examples (PII, financial, intellectual property).
*   **Data Handling Policies:** Reminders on classified information, "Need to Know" principle.
*   **Secure Storage & Transmission:** Proper use of encrypted drives, approved file-sharing tools.
*   **Clean Desk Policy:** Physical security reminders.
*   **Actionable Advice:** Think before you share; only access data you need for your job.

---

#### **Module Section 5: Safe Browsing & Software Usage**
*   **Recognizing Malicious Websites:** HTTPS, certificate warnings.
*   **Downloading Software:** Only from trusted sources, avoid pirated software.
*   **Software Updates:** Importance of keeping operating systems and applications patched.
*   **Actionable Advice:** If something looks suspicious, close it.

---

#### **Module Section 6: What to Do If You Suspect an Incident (Reporting)**
*   **Key Message:** "When in doubt, report it!"
*   **How to Report:** Clear instructions on who to contact (e.g., IT Help Desk, Security Team email/phone).
*   **What Information to Provide:** Screenshots, timestamps, observed symptoms.
*   **What NOT to Do:** Don't try to fix it yourself, don't spread panic.
*   **Actionable Advice:** Your swift action can prevent major damage.

---

### Delivery Methods & Assessment
*   **Delivery:** Mandatory online e-learning module (annual), supplemented with periodic short videos/email reminders, and optional in-person Q&A sessions.
*   **Assessment:** Short quiz at the end of the module (e.g., 80% passing score required). Phishing simulation exercises.

## Reflection Questions

1.  How does a well-designed security awareness training program directly contribute to reducing the likelihood and impact of security incidents?
2.  What are some challenges in making security awareness training engaging and effective for all employees?
3.  Why is it crucial for training to include clear instructions on "what to do if you suspect an incident"?

## Next Steps

*   [Identify Legal and Regulatory Reporting Requirements](13-legal-regulatory-reporting.md)
*   Further reading: [NIST SP 800-61 R2, Section 3.1.3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)

## Hints / Troubleshooting

*   **Keep it Simple**: Avoid overly technical jargon. Focus on clear, actionable advice.
*   **Real-world Examples**: Use relatable examples to illustrate concepts.
*   **Repetition**: Reinforce key messages through various channels and regular refreshers.
*   **Measure Effectiveness**: Use metrics (e.g., quiz scores, phishing click rates) to assess training impact.
