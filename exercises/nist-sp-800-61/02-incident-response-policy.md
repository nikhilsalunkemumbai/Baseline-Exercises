Title: Review and Develop Incident Response Policy Components
Objective: Understand the essential elements of an effective Incident Response Policy as guided by NIST SP 800-61, and outline a basic policy structure.
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Tools Needed: Access to NIST SP 800-61 R2 document, word processor or text editor
Setup Instructions:
    - Review Section 3.1 "Preparation" in NIST SP 800-61 R2, specifically focusing on policy development.

## Steps

1.  **Review NIST Guidance on Incident Response Policy**
    *   Revisit the NIST SP 800-61 R2 document.
    *   Locate sections that discuss the importance and components of an Incident Response Policy. Pay close attention to topics such as:
        *   Policy statement
        *   Goals of the IR program
        *   Reporting requirements
        *   Roles and responsibilities
        *   Metrics for measuring effectiveness

2.  **Identify Key Policy Elements**
    *   Based on your review, list at least 8-10 critical components that should be included in a comprehensive Incident Response Policy. Think about what information an organization needs to define before an incident occurs.

3.  **Outline a Basic Policy Structure**
    *   Using a word processor or text editor, create a basic outline for an Incident Response Policy.
    *   For each key element you identified, write a brief (1-2 sentences) placeholder description or objective that would be included under that section in a real policy document.

    *Example Section Headings:*
    *   1.0 Introduction and Purpose
    *   2.0 Scope
    *   3.0 Incident Response Goals
    *   4.0 Roles and Responsibilities
    *   5.0 Incident Reporting
    *   6.0 Policy Review and Maintenance
    *   7.0 Definitions
    *   8.0 Related Documents

4.  **Consider Practical Implementation**
    *   Reflect on how this policy would be communicated to employees and what training might be necessary to ensure compliance.
    *   Consider who would be the primary audience for this document (e.g., all employees, IR team, management).

# Incident Response Policy Outline

## 1.0 Introduction and Purpose
   *   Brief statement explaining the policy's objective to protect organizational assets and ensure business continuity by defining a structured approach to incident response.

## 2.0 Scope
   *   Defines to whom and what this policy applies (e.g., all employees, contractors, systems, data within the organization's control).

## 3.0 Incident Response Goals
   *   Outlines the primary objectives of the incident response program, such as minimizing damage, restoring services, and learning from incidents.

## 4.0 Roles and Responsibilities
   *   Assigns specific duties and authorities to individuals and teams involved in incident response (e.g., Incident Response Team Lead, security analysts, legal counsel).

## 5.0 Incident Reporting
   *   Details the procedures for identifying, documenting, and reporting security incidents, including communication channels and timelines.

## 6.0 Incident Classification and Prioritization
   *   Describes methods for categorizing incidents based on severity, impact, and type, and criteria for prioritizing response efforts.

## 7.0 Policy Review and Maintenance
   *   Specifies how often the policy will be reviewed and updated to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 8.0 Definitions
   *   Provides clear definitions for key terms used throughout the policy (e.g., "incident," "event," "compromise").

## 9.0 Related Documents
   *   Lists other relevant policies, standards, or guidelines that support the incident response effort (e.g., acceptable use policy, data retention policy).

## Reflection Questions

1.  Why is having a clearly defined Incident Response Policy crucial for any organization?
2.  What challenges might arise if roles and responsibilities are not clearly outlined in the policy?
3.  How does an IR policy contribute to regulatory compliance and risk management?

## Next Steps

*   [Practice Incident Categorization](03-incident-categorization.md)
*   Further reading: [NIST SP 800-61 R2, Section 3.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)

## Hints / Troubleshooting

*   **Focus on Structure**: Don't try to write a full policy; focus on the logical flow and essential headings.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness**: Policy documents should be clear, unambiguous, and easy to understand.
*   **Adapt to Context**: While NIST provides a framework, remember that each organization's policy will need to be tailored to its specific needs and risk profile.
